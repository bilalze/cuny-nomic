For the purposes of this rule, gameplay points are considered separately from penalties for lateness or absence or other reasons.

If a player loses enough gameplay points during the game of Nomic to end up with a negative gameplay point balance at the end of class, that gameplay point balance will be multiplied by -1, giving the player a positive gameplay point balance instead of a negative gameplay point balance. For example, if a player is left with -40 gameplay points at the end of the class meeting, that gameplay point balance is converted to 40 gameplay points.

If the rule passes, all players, except for the player proposing this rule, receives 15 gameplay points.
All points on the scoreboard when this rule passes are considered gameplay points.
