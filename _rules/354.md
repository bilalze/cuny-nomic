Players late to class recieve a point penalty equal to the minutes they are late exceeding 15. The penalty is not imposed if the delay is less than 15 minutes. Absence equals 50 point penalty. Penalty can be waived if valid excuse is provided to the professor before hand. All players recieve 10 points if this rule is passed.
